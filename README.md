# Crystal Copter

Crystal Copter is a mobile game that I developed back in 2014. Its primary purpose was to serve as a project for me to gain hands-on experience in the entire game development process, from concept to release on the Google Play Store.

## About the Game
Crystal Copter is an arcade-style game where players control a helicopter through a series of caves and collect valuable crystals along the way.
